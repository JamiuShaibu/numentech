# Funny Quotes
---
This is a simple full-stack web application designed to showcase CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a fun and interactive way. Users can sign in to the platform to post, view, edit, or delete funny quotes, making it a nice project for understanding how CRUD operations are implemented in a real-world application. This project is built using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To set up the project for development on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/jamiushaibu/numentech.git
cd numentech
```

2. Install API dependencies
The backend API dependencies are located in the root directory. Install them by running:

```
npm install
```

3. Install Client dependencies
The frontend client dependencies are located in the numentech/api directory. Navigate to this directory and install the dependencies:

## Running the Application
After installing the dependencies for both the API and the client, you are ready to run the application.
1. Start the API server
In the root directory (numentech), start the API server:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:8800/.

## Note
The above command could be simplified with a single command if the project was containerized
